title: üêß How to install Linux on Windows with WSL
description: The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

## Install WSL Command

Open PowerShell or Windows Command, run

```sh
wsl --install
```

_or_

```sh
wsl --list --online # For a valid list of distribution names
wsl --install -d <Distribution Name> # <Distribution Name> from the list got by upper command
```

## Add a User for WSL (Optional)

```sh
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username> # Add user to sudoers
```

## Install Visual Studio Code

[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Use Windows Proxy

**Ubuntu version at least to be 22.04**

In your `%UserProfile%` directory (use `cd ~` to access your home directory, which is typically your user profile, `C:\Users\<UserName>`), create `.wslconfig` file, paste the following configurations into it:

```
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

**After configuring this, you need to run `wsl --shutdown` to stop WSL first, and then relaunch terminal**

_If you are using [Clash Verge](https://github.com/clash-verge-rev/clash-verge-rev) for proxy, [TUN](https://wiki.metacubex.one/en/config/inbound/tun/) mode is recommended. FYI, the network hotspot sharing only works in `GVisor` mode._

## Install zsh

```sh
sudo apt install zsh
# Make zsh the default shell.
# Run below command WITHOUT sudo! If you use `sudo` it will change the shell not for your working user but for root
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
