title: üêß How to install Linux on Windows with WSL
description: The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

# Install WSL Command

Open PowerShell or Windows Command, run `wsl --install`. You can also use this command to install additional Linux distributions by running `wsl --install <Distribution Name>`. For a valid list of distribution names, run `wsl --list --online`.

# Add a User for WSL

```sh
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username> # add user to sudoers
```

# Use Windows Proxy

**Ubuntu version at least to be 22.04**

In your `%UserProfile%` directory(use `cd ~` to access your home directory, which is typically your user profile, `C:\Users\<UserName>`), create `.wslconfig` file, paste the following configurations into it:

```
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
autoProxy=true
```

**After configured this, you need to run `wsl --shutdown` to stop WSL first, and then relaunch terminal**
