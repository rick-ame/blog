title: üç™ What are SameSite Cookies?
description: SameSite prevents the browser from sending this cookie along with cross-site requests. The main goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage. It also provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.

## Introduction

[SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. SameSite cookie restrictions provide partial protection against a variety of cross-site attacks, including [CSRF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF), [cross-site leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_leaks), and some [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) exploits.

## What is a Site in the Context of SameSite Cookies?

![Site Definition](../img/2024-05-02/site-definition.png)
In the context of SameSite cookie restrictions, a site is defined as the top-level domain ([TLD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLD)), usually something like `.com` or `.net`, plus one additional level of the domain name. This is often referred to as the TLD+1.

<Callout>
  You may come across the term "effective top-level domain" (eTLD). This is just
  a way of accounting for the reserved multipart suffixes that are treated as
  top-level domains in practice, such as `.co.uk`.

## What's the Difference Between a Site and an Origin?

![Site vs Origin](../img/2024-05-02/site-vs-origin.png)
The difference between a site and an origin is their scope; a site encompasses multiple domain names, whereas an origin only includes one. Two URLs are considered to have the same origin if they share the exact same scheme, domain name, and port. Although note that the port is often inferred from the scheme. The term "site" is much less specific as it only accounts for the scheme and last part of the domain name. Crucially, this means that a cross-origin request can still be same-site, but not the other way around.

| Request from              | Request to                 | Same-site?            | Same-origin?               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.com`      | Yes                   | Yes                        |
| `https://foo.example.com` | `https://bar.example.com`  | Yes                   | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.com:8080` | Yes                   | No: mismatched port        |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.co.uk`    | No: mismatched eTLD   | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com`     | `http://example.com`       | No: mismatched scheme | No: mismatched scheme      |

## How does SameSite Work?

Before the SameSite mechanism was introduced, browsers sent cookies in every request to the domain that issued them, even if the request was triggered by an unrelated third-party website. SameSite works by enabling browsers and website owners to limit which cross-site requests, if any, should include specific cookies.

All major browsers currently support the following SameSite restriction levels:

- `Strict`
- `Lax`
- `None`

Developers can manually configure a restriction level for each cookie they set, giving them more control over when these cookies are used. To do this, they just have to include the `SameSite` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` response header, along with their preferred value:

```http
Set-Cookie: session=sessionId; SameSite=Strict
```

<Callout>
  If the website issuing the cookie doesn't explicitly set a SameSite attribute,
  Chrome automatically applies `Lax` restrictions by default. This means that
  the cookie is only sent in cross-site requests that meet specific criteria,
  even though the developers never configured this behavior.
</Callout>

### Strict

If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute, browsers will not send it in any cross-site requests. In simple terms, this means that if the target site for the request does not match the site currently shown in the browser's address bar, it will not include the cookie. Although this is the most secure option, it can negatively impact the user experience in cases where cross-site functionality is desirable.

### Lax

If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Lax` attribute, this means that browsers will send the cookie in cross-site requests, but only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The request uses the `GET` method.
- The request resulted from a top-level navigation by the user.[^1]

### None

If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=None` attribute, this effectively disables SameSite restrictions altogether, regardless of the browser. As a result, browsers will send this cookie in all requests to the site that issued it, even those that were triggered by completely unrelated third-party sites.

There are legitimate reasons for disabling SameSite, such as when the cookie is intended to be used from a third-party context and doesn't grant the bearer access to any sensitive data or functionality. Tracking cookies are a typical example.

<Callout type="warning">
  The
  [`Secure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#secure)
  attribute must also be set when setting this value, like so `SameSite=None;
  Secure`. A `Secure` cookie is only sent to the server with an encrypted
  request over the HTTPS protocol. Note that insecure sites (`http:`) can't set
  cookies with the `Secure` directive, and therefore can't use `SameSite=None`.
</Callout>

[^1]: Such as clicking on a link. The cookie is not included in background requests, such as those initiated by scripts, iframes, or references to images and other resources.
