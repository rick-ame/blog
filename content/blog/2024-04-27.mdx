## Introduction

When you install Docker, you get two major components:

- The Docker client
- The Docker engine (sometimes called the "Docker daemon")

The Docker engine is the core software that runs and manages containers. It implements the runtime, API, and everything else required to run containers. Once installed, you can use the `docker version` command to test that the client and daemon (server) are running and talking to each other.

```sh
docker version
# Client:
# ...
# Server:
# ...
```

If you get a response back from both the Client and Server, you‚Äôre good to go. If not, check that the Docker daemon is running (`sudo systemctl status docker` on Linux).

## Images

Image, Docker image, container image, and [OCI (Open Container Initiative)](https://opencontainers.org/) image all mean the same thing. A container image is a read-only package that contains everything you need to run an application: application code, dependencies, a minimal OS, and metadata. A single image can be used to start one or more containers.

You get container images by pulling them from a registry. The most common registry is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but others exist (e.g., GitHub Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry, private registries). The pull operation downloads an image to your local Docker host where Docker can use it to start containers.

### Pulling Images

```sh
docker images                                   # List all local images; add --digests to see SHA256 digests.
docker pull <repository>:<tag>                  # Pull an image from a registry
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:latest # Pull from a Microsoft registry
```

Note: `tag` is optional and defaults to `latest`. The `latest` tag does **not** guarantee it is the most recent image in the repository.

### Filtering and Formatting

```sh
docker images --filter dangling=true
docker images --filter=reference="*:latest"
docker images --format "{{.Repository}}: {{.Tag}}: {{.Size}}"
```

Dangling images are untagged images (`<none>:<none>`) that are safe to remove.

### Deleting Images

```sh
docker rmi alpine:latest
```

Deleting an image removes it and its layers from your Docker host, unless those layers are shared by other images.

### Images and Layers

A Docker image is a stack of read-only layers. Each layer represents a set of file changes or additions. All images start with a base layer (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine). Adding dependencies or source code creates new layers. Layers are cached, so rebuilding similar images is fast.

Inspect image details:

```sh
docker inspect ubuntu:latest
docker history ubuntu:latest
```

---

## Containers

A container is a runtime instance of an image. It includes the image plus a thin writable layer and its own process tree, networking, and mounts.

### Running Containers

```sh
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```

- `-it`: Interactive terminal
- `-d`: Detached mode (run in background)
- `-p`: Port mapping (host:container)
- `--name`: Name your container

### Common Commands

- `docker ps`: List running containers (`-a` for all)
- `docker exec -it <container> bash`: Run a shell in a running container
- `docker stop <container>`: Stop a running container
- `docker start <container>`: Start a stopped container
- `docker rm <container>`: Remove a stopped container
- `docker inspect <container>`: Show detailed info

---

## Containerizing an App

The typical workflow:

1. Write your application code and dependencies.
1. Create a Dockerfile describing how to build and run your app.
1. Build the image: `docker build -t myapp:latest .`
1. (Optional) Push the image to a registry.
1. Run a container from the image.

### Example: Node.js App

```text title=".dockerignore"
node_modules
.git
.gitignore
*.md
dist
```

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM alpine
LABEL maintainer="foo@bar.com"
RUN apk add --update nodejs npm
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
ENV PORT 8080
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./index.js"]
```

### Multi-stage Builds for Production

Multi-stage builds reduce image size by separating build and runtime dependencies.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim AS base
ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
RUN corepack enable
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

FROM base AS prod-deps
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/pnpm/store pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile

FROM base AS build
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
RUN pnpm run build

FROM base
COPY --from=prod-deps /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app/dist
EXPOSE 8000
CMD [ "pnpm", "start" ]
```

Build with:

```sh
docker build -t multi:stage .
```

## Volumes and Persistent Data

Containers are ephemeral by default. To persist data, use **volumes**.

- Volumes are managed by Docker and exist outside the container lifecycle.
- Volumes can be shared between containers and mapped to external storage.
- Data in a volume persists even if the container is deleted.

### Creating and Using Volumes

```sh
docker volume create myvol
docker run -it --name voltainer --mount source=myvol,target=/vol alpine
```

- If you specify an existing volume, Docker will use the existing volume
- If you specify a volume that doesn‚Äôt exist, Docker will create it for you

### Volume Commands

- `docker volume ls`: List volumes
- `docker volume inspect <volume>`: Inspect a volume
- `docker volume prune`: Remove unused volumes (**dangerous**)
- `docker volume rm <volume>`: Remove a specific volume

---

## Deploying Apps with Compose

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) lets you define and run multi-container applications using YAML.

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python app.py
    ports:
      - target: 8080
        published: 5000
    networks:
      - counter-net
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: counter-vol
        target: /app
  redis:
    image: 'redis:alpine'
    networks:
      - counter-net
networks:
  counter-net:
volumes:
  counter-vol:
```

- `build`: Build from Dockerfile in current directory
- `command`: Command to run
- `ports`: Map container to host ports
- `networks`: Attach to a network
- `volumes`: Mount a volume

Start the app:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Compose Commands

- `docker compose stop`: Stop all containers
- `docker compose rm`: Remove stopped containers and networks
- `docker compose restart`: Restart containers
- `docker compose ps`: List containers and their status
- `docker compose down`: Stop and remove containers and networks

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files into images.
- Keep images small by using multi-stage builds and minimal base images (e.g., Alpine).
- Tag images with meaningful versions, not just `latest`.
- Use environment variables for configuration (`ENV` in Dockerfile, `-e` in `docker run`).
- Regularly prune unused images, containers, and volumes to save disk space.
- Use health checks (`HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile) for production containers.
- Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`.

## Summary

Docker revolutionized application development by making it easy to build, ship, and run applications anywhere. Containers are lightweight, portable, and efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. By mastering images, containers, volumes, and Compose, you can streamline development, testing, and deployment workflows.
