# Getting Started

To use Next.jsW 15, you can run this command:

```sh
pnpx create-next-app@rc
```

and follow the prompts to generate a new project.

# React Compiler (Experimental)

The [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) is a feature of React 19 that allows it to add automatic optimizations to your code and reduces the necessity of doing manual memoization with APIs such as `useMemo` and `useCallback`, improving code simplicity and maintainability.

Next.js 15 now supports for the React Compiler,

1. Install `babel-plugin-react-compiler`:

   ```sh
   pnpm add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler
   ```

1. Add `experimental.reactCompiler` option in `next.config.mjs`:

   ```js title="next.config.mjs" {2-4}
   const nextConfig = {
     experimental: {
       reactCompiler: true,
     },
   }
   export default nextConfig
   ```

   Or you can configure the compiler to run in "opt-in" mode as follows:

   ```js title="next.config.mjs" {2-6}
   const nextConfig = {
     experimental: {
       reactCompiler: {
         compilationMode: 'annotation',
       },
     },
   }
   module.exports = nextConfig
   ```

   This makes it so the compiler will only compile components and hooks annotated with a `use memo` directive. Please note that the annotation mode is a temporary one to aid early adopters, and that React donâ€™t intend for the `use memo` directive to be used for the long term.

   ```tsx
   export default function App() {
     'use memo'
     // ...
   }
   ```

<Callout>
  The React Compiler is currently only possible to use in Next.js through a
  Babel plugin, which could result in slower build times.

# Hydration error improvements

Next.js 14.1 [made improvements](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-1#improved-error-messages-and-fast-refresh) to error messages and hydration errors, but Next.js 15 makes them even better. Hydration errors now display the source code of the error with suggestions on how to fix the problem.

For example, this was a previous hydration error message in Next.js 14.1:
![Hydration Error Before](../img/nextjs/hydration-error-before-light.avif)

Next.js 15 RC has improved this to:
![Hydration Error After](../img/nextjs/hydration-error-after-light.avif)

# Caching updates

With Next.js 15, theyâ€™re changing how caching works for fetch requests, GET Route Handlers, and Client Router Cache. Before, things were cached by default, now they wonâ€™t be unless you choose to. If you want to retain the previous behavior, you can continue to opt-into caching.

## `fetch` Requests are no longer cached by default

Next.js uses the Web [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) cache option to configure how a server-side fetch request interacts with the framework's persistent HTTP cache:

```ts
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' | 'no-store' })
```

- `no-store` - fetch a resource from a remote server on every request and do not update the cache. In Next.js 15, this is used by default if a `cache` option is not provided. This means **fetch requests will not be cached by default**.
- `force-cache` - fetch a resource from the cache (if it exists) or a remote server and update the cache. In Next.js 14, this was used by default if a `cache` option was not provided, unless a dynamic function or dynamic config option was used.

## `GET` Route Handlers are no longer cached by default

In Next 14, Route Handlers that used the `GET` HTTP method were cached by default unless they used a dynamic function or dynamic config option. In Next.js 15, `GET` functions are **not cached by default**.

You can still opt into caching using a static route config option using the following code:

```ts
export dynamic = 'force-static'
```

Special Route Handlers like `sitemap.ts`, `opengraph-image.tsx`, and `icon.tsx`, and other `metadata files` remain static by default unless they use dynamic functions or dynamic config options.

## Client Router Cache no longer caches Page components by default

In Next.js 14.2.0, an experimental [`staleTimes`](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) flag was introduced to allow custom configuration of the Router Cache.

In Next.js 15, the client router cache no longer caches Page components by default, setting the default `staleTime` to 0. This ensures that navigating through the app always reflects the latest data for Page components. Despite this change, some behaviors remain the same:

- Shared layout data isnâ€™t refetched to support [partial rendering](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering).
- Cache is used for back/forward navigation to maintain scroll position.
- The [`Loading.js`](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) file is cached for 5 minutes or according to the `staleTimes.static` configuration.

You can opt into the previous Client Router Cache behavior by setting the following configuration:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {2-6}
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
    },
  },
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

# Incremental adoption of Partial Prerendering (Experimental)

Next.js 14 introduced [Partial Prerendering (PPR)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14#partial-prerendering-preview) - an optimization that combines static and dynamic rendering on the same page.

Next.js currently defaults to static rendering unless you use dynamic functions such as `cookies()`, `headers()`, and uncached data requests. These APIs opt an entire route into dynamic rendering. With PPR, you can wrap any dynamic UI in a Suspense boundary. When a new request comes in, Next.js will immediately serve a static HTML shell, then render and stream the dynamic parts in the same HTTP request.

To allow for incremental adoption, there is an `experimental_ppr` route config option for opting specific Layouts and Pages into PPR:

```tsx {3}
import { Suspense } from "react"
import { StaticComponent, DynamicComponent } from "@/app/ui"
export const experimental_ppr = true
export default function Page() {
  return (
     <>
	     <StaticComponent />
	     <Suspense fallback={...}>
		     <DynamicComponent />
	     </Suspense>
     </>
  )
}
```

To use the new option, youâ€™ll need to set the `experimental.ppr` config in your `next.config.mjs` file to `incremental`:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {2-4}
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

<Callout>
  Once all the segments have PPR enabled, itâ€™ll be considered safe for you to
  set the ppr value to true, and enable it for the entire app and all future
  routes.
</Callout>

# Executing code after a response with `next/after` (Experimental)

When you process a user request, you probably need to perform tasks such as logging, analysis, and other external system synchronization.

Since these tasks are not directly related to the response, the user should not have to wait for them to complete. Deferring the work after responding to the user poses a challenge because serverless functions stop computation immediately after the response is closed.

`after()` is a new experimental API that solves this problem by allowing you to schedule work to be done after the response has finished streaming, allowing secondary tasks to run without blocking the primary response.

To use it, add `experimental.after` to `next.config.mjs`:

```js title="next.config.mjs" {2-4}
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    after: true,
  },
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

Then, import the function in Server Components, Server Actions, Route Handlers, or Middleware.

```tsx {5-7}
import { unstable_after as after } from 'next/server'
import { log } from '@/app/utils'
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  // Secondary task
  after(() => {
    log()
  })
  // Primary task
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

# Changes to the `create-next-app`

The template design has been changed to a more minimalist design:
![Create Next App Design](../img/nextjs/create-next-app-light.avif)

When running `create-next-app`, thereâ€™s a new prompt asking if you want to enable `TurboPack` for development (defaults to No).:

```sh
âœ” Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? â€¦ No / Yes
```

To make getting started on a new project even easier, a new --empty flag has been added to the CLI. This will remove any extraneous files and styles, resulting in a minimal "hello world" page.

```sh
pnpx create-next-app@rc --empty
```

# Optimizing bundling of external packages (Stable)

Bundling external packages can improve the cold start performance of your application. In the App Router, external packages are bundled by default, and you can opt-out specific packages using the new [`serverExternalPackages`](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages) config option.

In the Pages Router, external packages are not bundled by default, but you can provide a list of packages to bundle using the existing [`transpilePackages`](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/transpilePackages) option. With this configuration option, you need to specify each package.
