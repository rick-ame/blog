title: üêß How to install Linux on Windows with WSL
description: The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

## What is WSL?

[WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It allows developers to use Linux tools, shells, and applications directly within Windows, without the need for a full virtual machine or dual-boot setup. WSL 2 uses a lightweight virtual machine for improved performance and compatibility.

---

## Install WSL Command

Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:

```sh
wsl --install
```

This command installs WSL 2 and the default Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu LTS).

To see available distributions and install a specific one:

```sh
wsl --list --online           # List available distributions
wsl --install -d <DistroName> # Replace <DistroName> with your choice, e.g., Ubuntu-22.04
```

After installation, restart your computer if prompted.

---

## Initial Setup and User Management

When you launch your new Linux distribution for the first time, you'll be prompted to create a user and password. If you want to add additional users later:

```sh
sudo adduser <username>
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> # Add user to sudoers group
```

Switch to the new user:

```sh
su - <username>
```

## Install Visual Studio Code

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it on Windows.

To use VS Code with WSL, install the [Remote - WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl). This allows you to open and develop inside your WSL environment directly from VS Code.

---

## Use Windows Proxy in WSL2

**Note:** Ubuntu version should be at least 22.04 for best compatibility.

To enable mirrored networking (useful for proxy and network access):

1. In your Windows home directory (`%UserProfile%`, typically `C:\Users\<UserName>`), create a `.wslconfig` file:

   ```
   [wsl2]
   networkingMode=mirrored
   ```

1. After saving, restart WSL:

   ```sh
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

   Then relaunch your terminal.

_If you use [Clash Verge](https://github.com/clash-verge-rev/clash-verge-rev) for proxy, [TUN mode](https://wiki.metacubex.one/en/config/inbound/tun/) is recommended. Note: network hotspot sharing only works in `GVisor` mode._

## Install zsh and oh-my-zsh

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh
# Make zsh the default shell for your user (do NOT use sudo)
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for a better shell experience:

   ```sh
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```

1. [Change theme](/blog/2023-10-12#oh-my-zsh) or customize plugins as desired.

---

## Install Homebrew (Linuxbrew)

[Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#install) is a popular package manager. Install it with:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, follow the instructions to add Homebrew to your shell profile.

---

## Useful WSL Commands

```sh
explorer.exe .       # Open current folder in Windows Explorer
wsl.exe hostname -I  # Get the WSL2 IP address
wsl.exe --update     # Update WSL to the latest version
wsl --status         # Show WSL configuration and version info
```

---

## Configure Port Forwarding to Access WSL2 from the Local Network

By default, WSL2 runs in a virtualized network, so services (e.g., web servers) are not accessible from other devices on your LAN. To expose a port:

<Callout type="warning">
  Run the following commands in PowerShell (Admin).
</Callout>

1. Enable port forwarding from Windows to WSL2:

   ```ps1
   netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=<PORT> connectaddress=<WSL2_IP> connectport=<PORT>
   # Example for port 3000:
   netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=3000 connectaddress=localhost connectport=3000
   ```

1. Allow the port in Windows Firewall:

   ```ps1
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow_TCP_<PORT>" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort <PORT> -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
   # Example for port 3000:
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow_TCP_3000" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3000 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
   ```

1. Verify forwarding:

   ```ps1
   netsh interface portproxy show all
   ```

1. Delete an unwanted forwarding rule:

   ```ps1
   netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=<PORT>
   ```

## Additional Tips

### Terminal Configurations

- **Size:** 72 x 20
- **Theme:** Campbell (or your preference)
- **Opacity:** 95%

### File System Interoperability

- Access Windows files from WSL at `/mnt/c/Users/<UserName>/`
- Access WSL files from Windows at `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-22.04\home\<username>\`

### Updating and Upgrading

Keep your Linux environment up to date:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Clipboard Integration

Copy from WSL to Windows clipboard:

```sh
echo "hello" | clip.exe
```

Paste from Windows clipboard into WSL:

```sh
powershell.exe Get-Clipboard
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter networking issues, try restarting WSL: `wsl --shutdown`
- For GUI apps, install [WSLg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) (included by default in recent WSL2).
- For more advanced networking, see [WSL Networking Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking).
