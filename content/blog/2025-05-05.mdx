title: ðŸš¨ Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware
description: A massive security vulnerability was uncovered in Next.js and it breaks the authentication of many major applications. In short, It is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware.

## Background

- **Purpose of Next.js Middleware**: Next.js middleware allows developers to execute code before a request reaches a page, commonly used for authentication, redirection, and request/response modification.
- **Vulnerability Scenario**: Under certain conditions, middleware can become "corrupt", causing it to malfunction or even be bypassed or tampered with.

Middleware is often used as a gatekeeper for protected routes, performing checks such as verifying authentication tokens, user roles, or request integrity. If middleware is bypassed, unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive resources.

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **Root Cause**: Middleware corruption typically occurs due to misconfiguration or logical errors, such as:

  - Improper handling of edge cases (e.g., malformed headers or paths).
  - Conflicts with other Next.js features (e.g., API routes or static file serving).
  - Overly broad matcher patterns that unintentionally include or exclude routes.

- **Manifestations**:

  - Middleware may fail to intercept or modify requests correctly.
  - Attackers can craft malicious requests to bypass security checks.
  - Inconsistent behavior across environments (development vs. production).

A key technical detail: Next.js uses the header `x-middleware-subrequest` to prevent infinite recursion in middleware. If a request passes through middleware more than 5 times, Next.js will automatically bypass further middleware execution for that request. Attackers can exploit this by sending requests with the `x-middleware-subrequest` header set, causing the middleware to be skipped and authorization checks to be bypassed.

**Example attack scenario:**

1. Attacker crafts a request to a protected route, manually adding the `x-middleware-subrequest` header.
2. Next.js detects the header and, thinking the request has already passed through middleware multiple times, skips middleware execution.
3. The protected route is accessed without any authentication or authorization checks.

## Mitigation & Recommendations

- **Upgrade Next.js**: Always use the latest patched version of Next.js, as this vulnerability has been addressed in recent releases.
- **Strict Input Validation**: Validate all incoming request paths, headers, and methods. Explicitly reject requests containing suspicious or unexpected headers like `x-middleware-subrequest`.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Catch and handle exceptions to prevent middleware failure. Use try/catch blocks and log errors for monitoring.
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test against unusual paths, special characters, non-standard HTTP methods, and malformed headers to ensure middleware behaves as expected.
- **Limit Middleware Scope**: Use precise matcher paths in your `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts` to avoid unnecessary execution and reduce attack surface.
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Reduce reliance on external libraries or complex logic within middleware to lower the risk of bugs or conflicts.
- **Block Suspicious Headers**: At the edge (e.g., CDN, reverse proxy, or load balancer), filter out or block requests from external sources that contain internal-use headers like `x-middleware-subrequest`.

**Example: Rejecting requests with forbidden headers in middleware:**

```js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request) {
  if (request.headers.has('x-middleware-subrequest')) {
    return new NextResponse('Forbidden', { status: 403 })
  }
  // ...rest of your logic
}
```

## Additional Security Best Practices

- **Never trust client input**: Always validate and sanitize all user-supplied data, including headers, query parameters, and body content.
- **Defense in depth**: Do not rely solely on middleware for authorization. Implement checks at the API or page level as well.
- **Monitor and log**: Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious requests, especially those with unusual headers or patterns.
- **Review third-party middleware**: Audit any third-party packages or custom middleware for similar vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

This security issue has been fixed by Next.js. However, if patching to a safe version is infeasible, you must prevent external user requests containing the `x-middleware-subrequest` header from reaching your Next.js application. For technical details or code examples, refer to the original article: [Next.js and the Corrupt Middleware](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware).

To sum up: **never trust the client** and always validate all inputs, including headers. Security is a multi-layered processâ€”middleware is just one line of defense.
