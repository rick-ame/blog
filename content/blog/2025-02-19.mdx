In todayâ€™s multimedia-dominated society, images and sounds consume most of peopleâ€™s attention, while the written word is increasingly marginalized. This decline prompted Neil Postmanâ€™s alarmed proclamation: we now live in the age of _amusing ourselves to death_. Fingers swipe across screens, cycling through an endless stream of algorithmically curated short videos, draining peopleâ€™s patienceâ€”even content lasting mere dozens of seconds feels tedious.

This raises a question: Do you know how to read?

This question actually carries two layers of meaning.

The first is straightforward: Do you still read books regularly? Those reading this article likely believe that "reading is beneficial" and maintain some reading habits.

The second layer is the focus of this discussion: How should one read?

First, whether reading for self-improvement or leisure, book selection is crucial. An unsuitable book not only wastes time but may also impart misguided ideas. Books either too familiar or far beyond your current level will feel dull and unengaging. Forcing yourself to read them leads to distraction, leaving you with little knowledge gained and no real relaxation. So how do you choose the right book? My method is to skim the table of contents to gauge my interest in the topics covered. Then, I flip to random sections, read a few pages, and assess whether the writing style resonates. If something sparks a reaction, I can immerse myself in the book. If not, itâ€™s simply not the right timeâ€”perhaps the book and I are not yet meant to be.

Once youâ€™ve chosen a book, itâ€™s time to read. There are already many guides on reading techniques, such as the popular How to Read a Book. Why revisit this well-trodden topic? Here, the emphasis is differentâ€”rather than instructing how to read a book from start to finish, the focus is on how to effectively absorb its knowledge.

Weâ€™ve all had this experience: after finishing a book, it feels worthwhile, yet when asked about its plot, key ideas, or the authorâ€™s message, we struggle to recall. We remember our emotional response but not the content. Daysâ€”or even hoursâ€”later, that fleeting inspiration fades, leaving us unchanged.

Why does this happen? Because we read without active thinking. Our eyes scan text swiftly, but our minds process more slowly. Truly valuable knowledge requires pausesâ€”time for reflection and retention. Merely stuffing information into our brains may ease anxiety or feed vanity with a sense of accomplishment, but itâ€™s ultimately self-deception.

So when should you pause? Surely not after every sentenceâ€”that would make reading unbearably slow. The most effective approach is to stop whenever something moves you. Passages that donâ€™t resonate are either already familiar or beyond current comprehension; these can be skimmed. But when something strikes a chord, pause. Ask: Why did this stand out? How does it connect to other parts of the book? Have I encountered similar ideas elsewhere? Especially when a line feels revelatory, dissect why it resonates so deeply. Then consider: How can I apply this insight to my life? Knowledge only becomes skill when put into practice.

Remind yourself: Merely storing knowledge is uselessâ€”it must guide action. **Absorb â†’ Apply â†’ Reflect â†’ Adjust â†’ Share**. This cycle forms a true "knowledge chain," transforming reading into tangible growth. Only then can you say youâ€™ve truly read a book and learned from it.
