title: 🚀 Corepack - Simplifying Package Manager Management in Node.js
description: Managing different versions of package managers across various projects can be challenging. Corepack, introduced in Node.js v14.19.0 and v16.9.0, addresses this by acting as a bridge between Node.js and package managers like Yarn and pnpm. It ensures that your projects use the correct package manager versions without manual installations.

## 🔧 Enabling Corepack

By default, [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme) is included with Node.js but remains inactive. To activate it, run:

```sh
corepack enable
```

This command sets up shims for supported package managers, allowing you to use commands like yarn or pnpm directly.

## 📦 Installing Package Managers with Corepack

### Project-Specific Installation

If your project's `package.json` includes a `packageManager` field, Corepack automatically handles the installation:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.3"
}
```

or version along with the SHA-224 hash for validation:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.3+sha224.953c8233f7a92884eee2de69a1b92d1f2ec1655e66d08071ba9a02fa"
}
```

Running `yarn install` will prompt Corepack to download and use the specified version.

### Global Installation

To install a package manager globally, use:

```sh
corepack install -g pnpm@10.11.0
```

This makes the specified version available system-wide.

## 🛠️ Additional Corepack Commands

```sh
# Clear the local `COREPACK_HOME` cache directory.
corepack cache clean
corepack cache clear
# Retrieve the latest available version for the current major release line of the package manager used in the local project, and update the project to use it.
corepack up
```

## 🧪 Corepack in CI/CD and Docker Environments

In continuous integration or Docker setups, you might wonder if running `corepack install` is necessary. If your `package.json` specifies the `packageManager` field and you've enabled Corepack, it will automatically handle the required installations. However, pre-installing the package manager using `corepack install` can be beneficial in environments with limited or no internet access.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Exact Version Specification**: Ensure that the `packageManager` field specifies an exact version (`packageManager@x.y.z`). Using version ranges or tags like `latest` is not supported and will result in errors. The SHA-224 hash is optional but strongly recommended as a security practice.
- **Supported Package Managers**: Currently, permitted values for the package manager are `yarn`, `npm`, and `pnpm`.

## 📚 Conclusion

Corepack streamlines the management of package managers in Node.js projects, ensuring consistency and reducing setup complexities. By leveraging Corepack, you can:

- Automatically install and use the correct package manager versions specified in your projects.
- Simplify onboarding for new contributors by eliminating manual package manager installations.
- Enhance reproducibility across different environments, including CI/CD pipelines and Docker containers.
