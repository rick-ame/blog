title: 🚀 Corepack - Simplifying Package Manager Management in Node.js
description: Managing different versions of package managers across various projects can be challenging. Corepack, introduced in Node.js v14.19.0 and v16.9.0, addresses this by acting as a bridge between Node.js and package managers like Yarn and pnpm. It ensures that your projects use the correct package manager versions without manual installations.

## 🔧 Enabling Corepack

By default, [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme) is included with Node.js but remains inactive. To activate it, run:

```sh
corepack enable
```

This command sets up shims for supported package managers, allowing you to use commands like `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `npm` directly, even if they are not globally installed.

## 📦 Installing Package Managers with Corepack

### Project-Specific Installation

If your project's `package.json` includes a `packageManager` field, Corepack automatically handles the installation:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.3"
}
```

or specify the version along with the SHA-224 hash for integrity validation:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "yarn@3.2.3+sha224.953c8233f7a92884eee2de69a1b92d1f2ec1655e66d08071ba9a02fa"
}
```

When you run `yarn install` (or `pnpm install`), Corepack will download and use the specified version, ensuring consistency across all contributors and CI environments.

> **Why use the hash?**  
> The SHA-224 hash ensures that the downloaded package manager binary matches the expected version, protecting against supply chain attacks.

### Global Installation

To install a package manager globally (for use outside of specific projects), use:

```sh
corepack install -g pnpm@10.11.0
```

This makes the specified version available system-wide, but project-specific versions (from `package.json`) will always take precedence when inside a project directory.

---

## 🛠️ Additional Corepack Commands

```sh
# Clear the local Corepack cache directory.
corepack cache clean
corepack cache clear

# Upgrade the package manager version in your project to the latest for the current major version.
corepack up

# Disables Corepack shims, reverting to globally installed package managers.
corepack disable
```

## 🧪 Corepack in CI/CD and Docker Environments

In continuous integration or Docker setups, you might wonder if running `corepack install` is necessary. If your `package.json` specifies the `packageManager` field and you've enabled Corepack, it will automatically handle the required installations. However, pre-installing the package manager using `corepack prepare` or `corepack install` can be beneficial in environments with limited or no internet access, or to ensure deterministic builds.

**Example Dockerfile snippet:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:20
RUN corepack enable
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lock
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Exact Version Specification**:  
  Ensure that the `packageManager` field specifies an exact version (`packageManager@x.y.z`). Using version ranges or tags like `latest` is not supported and will result in errors. The SHA-224 hash is optional but strongly recommended as a security practice.
- **Supported Package Managers**:  
  Currently, permitted values for the package manager are `yarn`, `npm`, and `pnpm`.
- **Legacy Node.js**:  
  If you are using Node.js versions older than v14.19.0 or v16.9.0, Corepack is not included by default. You can install it globally via npm:
  ```sh
  npm i -g corepack
  ```
- **Lockfile Consistency**:  
  Always commit your lockfiles (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `package-lock.json`) to ensure reproducible installs.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- **"Command not found" errors:**  
  Make sure Corepack is enabled (`corepack enable`) and your Node.js version is recent enough.
- **Version mismatch warnings:**  
  If the locally installed package manager version does not match the one specified in `package.json`, Corepack will warn you and use the correct version.
- **Network issues:**  
  If Corepack cannot download the required package manager, check your proxy settings or pre-prepare the version with `corepack prepare`.

## 📚 Conclusion

Corepack streamlines the management of package managers in Node.js projects, ensuring consistency and reducing setup complexities. By leveraging Corepack, you can:

- Automatically install and use the correct package manager versions specified in your projects.
- Simplify onboarding for new contributors by eliminating manual package manager installations.
- Enhance reproducibility across different environments, including CI/CD pipelines and Docker containers.
- Improve security by pinning exact package manager versions and hashes.
