## 🍎 MacOS

### Terminal Customization

Enhance your MacOS Terminal with a custom theme:

1. [Download the theme file](/assets/rick.terminal)
1. Import it into the Terminal App via Preferences > Profiles > Import.

**Tip:** Try [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for advanced features like split panes, search, and better color support.

### Homebrew

> The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)

Homebrew makes installing and managing software on MacOS effortless.

- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Common Homebrew commands:**

```sh
brew search <name>        # Search for packages
brew info <package>       # Show package details
brew install <package>    # Install a package
brew update               # Update Homebrew
brew upgrade              # Upgrade installed packages
brew list                 # List installed packages, alias brew ls
brew uninstall <package>  # Remove a package, alias brew remove/rm
```

**Tip:** Use `brew doctor` to troubleshoot issues and `brew autoremove`, `brew cleanup` to free up disk space.

### Oh My Zsh

> A delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.

- [Install oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

#### Theme Customization

1. [Download the custom theme](/assets/rick.zsh-theme)
1. Place it in `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes`
1. Set `ZSH_THEME="rick"` in your `$HOME/.zshrc`

**Tip:** If you use Miniconda, try [this theme](/assets/rick-conda.zsh-theme) and set `ZSH_THEME="rick-conda"`.

## 🐍 Python Environment

### Virtual Environment

Create and manage isolated Python environments:

### Jupyter Notebook

**Recommended online notebook:**  
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

**Run shell commands in a notebook:**

- With leading `!`:

  ```ipynb
  !python -V
  ```
